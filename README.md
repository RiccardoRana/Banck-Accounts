# Bank-Accounts
This is just a little project i've done during my Javascript learning path. 

In this project i've created 4 bank-style accounts to which the user can log in with the right credetials.
In this little application is also possible to transfer money to one account to another, request loans and to eliminate one account.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:

1) HTML5
2) CSS3
3) JAVASCRIPT
   -Prettier
   -Strict mode
